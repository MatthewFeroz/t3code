# Usage and limits

## Understand your usage

**Usage** combines Codex, Claude Code, and Grok Build session history from your connected
environments. It shows token use, cache savings, model breakdowns, and estimated API-equivalent
cost. These estimates are not your subscription bill.

Totals depend on the history available on each server. Grok turns without a saved completed-turn
record are missing from the totals.

On web and desktop, use the environment dropdown to filter costs, tokens, and limits. All
environments are selected by default. The dropdown shows which environments are still scanning;
results appear as each one responds.

If recent work is missing or a new model shows no cost, refresh to rescan session history and
update model pricing.

## Set custom model prices

On web or desktop, open the environment dropdown on **Usage**, then choose **Model prices** to add,
edit, or reset a model's estimated price. **Apply to** starts with your current Usage filter;
choose all environments or select individual destinations. Enter the exact model ID and USD
rates per million input and output tokens. You can enter any model ID, including models
without public pricing.

Cache read and cache write rates are optional and use the input rate when blank. Enter `0` for
tokens that are free. Saved prices replace automatic pricing for all of that environment's
history and are shared with clients connected to it. When environments have different prices,
cells show **Mixed**. Edit rates directly in the table, then choose **Save changes** to apply all
edited rows. Untouched cells keep each environment's rate. Select one environment to inspect its
prices. **Reset to automatic** marks a model's override for removal when you save; you can undo
it before saving.

Each destination reports whether the change saved. Offline or unavailable environments are
marked **Not saved**. Reconnect them and choose **Retry failed saves** to finish the same change
without writing again to environments that already saved. Changes are not queued after you close
the dialog.

## Track subscription limits

**Usage → Limits** pools every subscription account it can see per provider, so with several Codex
or Claude accounts across your environments and hubs you read one number per window rather than a
list. Each window card shows how much of the pool is left and a bar with one segment per account,
kept in the same column across windows. Accounts are ordered by their 5-hour reset, soonest
first, or by the first available window when no account reports a 5-hour limit. A gap means the
account does not report that window. When the provider reports reset times, the card also says
when the next reset lands and how much it hands back. The hatched
part of a segment is what that reset restores. Tap a segment or account row for the account's plan,
where it is signed in, and its reset time. On web, you can hover too. Codex accounts with banked
reset credits show a ticket count and the **Use reset** action in the account details. On narrow screens, numbered rows below
the bar show each account's quota, countdown, and credits. Tap a row to open its details.

The same account signed in on more than one environment, or reported by a hub as well, counts once.
Filter with the environment dropdown to see what a single machine has.

If a window looks stale, refresh Limits to re-check every provider and hub.

Pick `/usage-limits` from the composer's command menu, or send it as a message, to check the
current model's limits without leaving the conversation. The result opens above the composer and
closes when you dismiss it or send your next message. It uses the same snapshot as **Usage → Limits**, so it does not run the agent or refresh
anything. The command is offered only for providers that appear under **Usage → Limits**.

API-key accounts may not report subscription limits. This also applies to Claude connections
using a proxy through `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`.

## Connect a CLIProxyAPI hub

To see pooled accounts, open **Settings → Providers → Usage providers → Add hub**. Choose the
environment that will connect to the hub and enter its URL and management key.

The accounts appear under **Usage → Limits**. Codex accounts show banked reset credits; select an
account and choose **Use reset** to redeem one. No hub plugin is required.

This connection supplies usage information; configure
the provider separately to send agent requests through the hub. Remove the hub from the same
settings section when you no longer need it.

## Add subscription usage to your home screen

On iOS or Android, open T3 Code and connect your environments, then add the **Subscription usage**
widget from the widget gallery. iOS also offers an extra-large iPad widget and a rectangular
Lock Screen widget. Resize the Android widget to show more limits. Tap to open **Usage → Limits**.

The widget shows pooled remaining Codex and Claude quotas, reset times, and the snapshot time.
The most constrained limits appear first. Account identities and credentials stay in the app.
Missing or expired readings show a prompt instead of a guessed allowance.

On iOS, long-press a widget and choose **Edit Widget** to select **Both**, **Session**,
or **Weekly** separately for Codex and Claude. Each widget keeps its own selections.
Only limits reported by your subscription appear; the Lock Screen shows the tightest
selected limit for each provider.

Opening T3 checks connected environments at most once every five minutes and continues checking
while the app is active. The widget does not fetch while the app is suspended. Readings expire
after fifteen minutes or a reported reset; Android may delay that display update to conserve
battery. Reopen the app while your environment is reachable to refresh. Removing an environment
removes its data from the widget.

If the widget is missing from the gallery, update the installed app and open it once. Widgets
require an app build that includes them; iOS builds without widget extensions do not offer them.
